# Gauss-Seidel-iterative-method-to-solve-linear-equation-systems
The Guass-Seidel method is a improvisation of the Jacobi method. This method is named after mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) and Philipp L. Seidel (1821–1896). This modification often results in higher degree of accuracy within fewer iterations.

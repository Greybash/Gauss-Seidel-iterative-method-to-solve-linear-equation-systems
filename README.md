# Gauss-Seidel-iterative-method-to-solve-linear-equation-systems
The Guass-Seidel method is a improvisation of the Jacobi method. This method is named after mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) and Philipp L. Seidel (1821–1896). This modification often results in higher degree of accuracy within fewer iterations.

In Jacobi method the value of the variables is not modified until next iteration, whereas in Gauss-Seidel method the value of the variables are modified as soon as new value is evaluated. For instance, in Jacobi method the value of xi(k) is not modified until the (k + 1)th iteration but in Gauss-Seidel method the value of xi(k) changes in in kth iteration only.
This is to take Jacobi’s Method one step further. Where the better solution is x = (x1, x2, … , xn), if x1(k+1) is a better approximation to the value of x1 than x1(k) is, then it would better that we have found the new value x1(k+1) to use it (rather than the old value that isx1(k)) in finding x2(k+1), … , xn(k+1). So x1(k+1) is found as in Jacobi’s Method, but in finding x2(k+1), instead of using the old value of x1(k) and old values of x3(k),…, xn(k), we then use the new value x1(k+1) and the old values x3(k), … , xn(k), and similarly for finding x3(k+1), … , xn(k+1). This process to find the solution of the given linear equation is called the Gauss-Seidel Method
The Gauss–Seidel method is an iterative technique for solving a square system of n (n=3) linear equations with unknown x.
